## World News Web App

**Frontend Project | React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS**

The **World News Web App** is a frontend-focused project built to strengthen my understanding of **React fundamentals**, **data fetching**, **component-driven architecture**, and **UI/UX design**. It consumes the **World News free API** to display real-time news content in a clean, responsive interface.

### Key Features

- Fetches and displays live news articles from a public API
- Modular, reusable React components for articles, lists, and layout
- Responsive UI built with **Tailwind CSS**
- Strong typing with **TypeScript** for safer data handling and clearer component contracts
- Fast development workflow powered by **Vite**

### Project Goals

- Practice working with external APIs using `fetch` / async data flows
- Reinforce React concepts such as props, state, conditional rendering, and component composition
- Improve UI/UX instincts through layout, spacing, and responsive design
- Build confidence structuring a real-world frontend project with modern tooling

### What I Will Learn

- Handling API data and loading/error states in React
- Designing flexible components that adapt to different data shapes
- Using Tailwind utility classes to rapidly iterate on UI design
- Leveraging TypeScript to catch bugs early and document intent

This project is part of my ongoing **fetch-app series**, focused on building practical, API-driven applications to solidify core frontend skills.
